# Declutter Browser History

Some websites spam your browser history and make it difficult to find the interesting links again. Block pages from showing up in the browser history with this extension.

## Use cases

- Block websites which you do not need in your history, e.g. aggregators like Hacker News. That way the articles you clicked on still remain in the history while the aggregator page will not.
- Social networks like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.
- Remove redirect pages: login, SAML, 2FA.
- Some tools like Slack, Kibana, produce a lot of history entries without much benefit
- If you often misspell a domain and then it gets added to history making it more probable to do the same mistake again.

## How to use

1. Install extension
2. Under options, add URLs you want to be hidden
3. Go to a page you just blocked from showing up and marvel at your uncluttered browser history
